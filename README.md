# MR Miyagi 

## Aim: Ask for user_input and depending on the input Mr Miyagi will respond accordingly.

### 1. Welcome message: "Hello start interacting with Mr Miyagi:"
### 2. Every time the user asks a question Mr Miyagi will respond with: "Questions are wise, but not for now. Wax on, Wax off!"
### 3. Every statement/ questions must start with 'Sensei', if not Mr Miyagi will respond with: "You are smart, but not wise - address me as Sensei, please"
### 4. Every time the user mentions 'block' or 'blocking' Mr Miyagi will respond with: "Remember, best block, not to be there.."
### 5. For anything else, Mr Miyagi responds with: "Do not lose focus. Wax on. Wax off."
### 6. The while loop will continue until the user inputs 'Sensei, I am at peace', for that Mr Miyagi will say "Sometimes, what heart know, head forgets" and exits.
